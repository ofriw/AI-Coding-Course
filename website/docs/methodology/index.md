# Methodology

This module teaches you the systematic approach to working with AI coding agents: how to craft effective prompts, ground agents in the right context, and maintain control over the development process.

## Module Overview

Understanding the tools is only the first step. This module covers the methodologies and techniques that separate effective AI-assisted development from frustrating trial-and-error.

## What You'll Learn

### High-Level Methodology

- **Detach from code** - Why fixing the prompt is often faster than fixing generated code
- **Plan > Execute > Validate** - The three-phase workflow for reliable results
- **Task sizing** - Breaking work into agent-appropriate chunks
- **Engineering focus** - Optimize context and prompts, not generated code

### Prompting 101

- **Clear instructions** - Direct, imperative communication (no "please" or "thank you")
- **Persona assignment** - When and how to set agent roles
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) & Chain-of-Draft (CoD)** - Structured reasoning patterns
- **Applied structure** - Using markdown, JSON, and other formats for clarity

### Grounding

- **Code understanding** - Agentic search vs semantic search
- **U Attention Curve** - How context position affects agent performance
- **Sub-agents** - Delegating research and exploration tasks
- **Multi-source grounding** - ChunkHound for code, ArguSeek for documentation/web

## Lessons in This Module

1. **High-Level Methodology** - The Plan > Execute > Validate workflow
2. **Prompting 101** - Effective communication patterns with agents
3. **Grounding** - Providing the right context for accurate results

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Understanding the Tools](../understanding-the-tools/index.md) (all lessons)
- Access to a CLI coding agent (e.g., Claude Code, Aider, Cursor)

## Time Commitment

This module takes approximately **2-3 hours** to complete, including hands-on exercises.
