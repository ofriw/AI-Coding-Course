# Practical Techniques

This module brings everything together with production-ready workflows: onboarding to new codebases, planning and executing complex tasks, debugging issues, and reviewing codeâ€”all with AI assistance.

## Module Overview

Theory meets practice. These lessons cover real-world scenarios senior engineers face daily: understanding unfamiliar codebases, debugging production issues, reviewing PRs, and maintaining code quality with AI agents.

## What You'll Learn

### Project Onboarding

- **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md files** - Codifying project context
- **Project story** - Architecture, tech stack, common commands
- **Automated onboarding** - Using agents to bootstrap context files

### Planning & Execution

- **Effective grounding** - Research before coding
- **Asking questions** - When to clarify vs infer
- **Detailed planning** - Breaking down complex features
- **Autonomous execution** - Parallel tasks and multitasking

### Tests as Guardrails

- **Human verification vs AI execution** - When to trust automation
- **Test-driven workflows** - Using tests to validate agent output
- **Debug test command** - Fixing failing tests with agents

### Reviewing Code

- **Pre-commit review** - Quality checks before version control
- **AI-assisted commits** - Meaningful commit messages and atomic changes
- **PR reviews** - Analyzing other developers' code with agent assistance

### Debugging

- **Code inspection** - Systematic analysis of bugs
- **Reproduction environments** - Docker, scripts, env setup
- **Log and database analysis** - Letting agents inspect runtime state
- **Remote debugging** - Helper scripts for production issues
- **Evidence-based fixes** - Requiring proof before accepting solutions
