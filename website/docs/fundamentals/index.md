# AI Coding Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of the AI Coding Course. In this module, you'll build a solid foundation for understanding and working with AI coding assistants.

## Module Overview

This module covers the essential concepts you need to understand before diving into AI-assisted development:

- How AI coding assistants work under the hood
- Understanding capabilities and limitations
- Mental models for effective AI collaboration
- When to use (and not use) AI assistance
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## What You'll Learn

### Understanding AI Models

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and code generation
- Token limits and context windows
- Temperature and sampling in code generation
- Determinism vs. creativity in outputs

### Effective AI Collaboration

- The developer-AI partnership model
- Critical thinking and code verification
- Understanding AI suggestions
- Building trust through validation

### Practical Foundations

- Setting up your AI development environment
- First interactions with AI coding tools
- Reading and evaluating AI-generated code
- Iterative refinement techniques

## Lessons in This Module

1. **Introduction to AI Agent-Driven Development** - The paradigm shift and First Principles (what LLMs really are)
2. **What Are AI Agents?** - Understanding agent architecture, execution workflows, and the engineer-operator role
3. **The Four Operating Principles** - Fundamental constraints that govern successful agent operation
4. **How LLMs Generate Code** - Technical foundations and behavioral patterns you need to know
5. **Mental Models for AI Collaboration** - Thinking effectively with AI (coming soon)
6. **Setting Up Your Environment** - Tools and configuration (coming soon)
7. **Your First AI-Assisted Project** - Hands-on practice (coming soon)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you:

- Have read the [course introduction](/docs)
- Have access to at least one AI coding tool
- Have a development environment set up

## Time Commitment

This module takes approximately **3-4 hours** to complete, including hands-on exercises.
