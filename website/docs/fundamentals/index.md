# AI Coding Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of the AI Coding Course. In this module, you'll build a solid foundation for understanding and working with AI coding assistants.

## Module Overview

This module covers the essential concepts you need to understand before diving into AI-assisted development:

- How AI coding assistants work under the hood
- Understanding capabilities and limitations
- Mental models for effective AI collaboration
- When to use (and not use) AI assistance
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## What You'll Learn

### Understanding AI Models

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and code generation
- Token limits and context windows
- Temperature and sampling in code generation
- Determinism vs. creativity in outputs

### Effective AI Collaboration
