# Advanced Prompting Techniques

Learn to communicate effectively with AI coding assistants to get the results you need. This module focuses on the art and science of prompting for code generation.

## Module Overview

Effective prompting is the key skill that separates mediocre from exceptional AI-assisted development. This module teaches you systematic approaches to crafting prompts that generate high-quality, production-ready code.

## What You'll Learn

### Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

- Anatomy of an effective prompt
- Context, constraints, and specifications
- Examples and few-shot learning
- Iterative prompt refinement

### Advanced Techniques

- Chain-of-thought prompting for complex logic
- Decomposing large tasks into smaller prompts
- Providing codebase context effectively
- Handling edge cases and error scenarios

### Domain-Specific Prompting

- API and integration development
- Database design and queries
- Frontend component creation
- Backend service implementation
- Testing and test generation

### Optimization Strategies

- Minimizing tokens while maintaining clarity
- Reusing prompt templates
- Building a personal prompt library
- Learning from prompt failures
