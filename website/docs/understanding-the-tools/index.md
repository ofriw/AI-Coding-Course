# Understanding the Tools

This module establishes the foundational understanding of AI coding agents: the paradigm shift, what they actually are (LLM brain + agent body), and how they work under the hood.

## Module Overview

Before you can effectively operate AI coding agents, you need to understand the paradigm shift, their architecture, and limitations. This module strips away marketing terminology and gives you a technical foundation grounded in first principles.

## What You'll Learn

### The Paradigm Shift

- **CNC machine analogy** - Why AI coding requires an operator mindset, not a teammate mindset
- **First principles** - What LLMs really are: token prediction engines, not reasoning machines
- **Three critical operator errors** - Common misconceptions that lead to frustration

### Understanding Agents

- **Architecture** - LLM = brain (pattern matching), Agent = body (execution loop)
- **The Agent Loop** - How context, reasoning, and tools work together
- **CLI coding agents** - Why command-line agents differ from chat interfaces

## Lessons in This Module

1. **Introduction to AI Agent-Driven Development** - The paradigm shift and first principles
2. **Understanding Agents** - How agents execute code and manage workflows

## Prerequisites

- 3+ years of professional software engineering experience
- Familiarity with command-line tools and development workflows
- Access to a CLI coding agent (e.g., Claude Code, Aider, Cursor)

## Time Commitment

This module takes approximately **1.5-2 hours** to complete.
