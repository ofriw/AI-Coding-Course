# Architecture & Design with AI

Leverage AI for system design, architectural decisions, and high-level problem-solving. Learn when and how to use AI for design work versus implementation.

## Module Overview

AI assistants excel at certain architectural tasks while struggling with others. This module teaches you to use AI effectively for system design, architectural patterns, and technical decision-making.

## What You'll Learn

### AI-Assisted Design

- Using AI for system architecture brainstorming
- Design pattern selection and application
- Database schema design
- API design and specification
- Microservices vs. monolith decisions

### Effective Collaboration

- When to involve AI in design decisions
- Validating AI architectural suggestions
- Using AI to explore trade-offs
- Documenting design decisions with AI

### Practical Applications

- Designing scalable systems
- Security architecture
- Performance optimization strategies
- Cloud architecture patterns
- Legacy system modernization

### Design Documentation

- Architecture diagrams with AI
- Technical specification writing
- API documentation
- System design documents
