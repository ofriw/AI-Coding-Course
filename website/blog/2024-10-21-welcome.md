# Welcome to the AI Coding Course

We're excited to launch this comprehensive course on AI-assisted software engineering for experienced developers.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why This Course?

AI coding assistants have transformed how we write software, but many developers use them ineffectively. This course bridges that gap by teaching:

- **Systematic approaches** to prompting and code generation
- **Best practices** for integrating AI into professional workflows
- **Critical evaluation** of AI-generated code
- **Production-ready patterns** that work in real-world projects

## What Makes This Course Different?

### 1. For Experienced Developers

This isn't an introduction to programming. We assume you:

- Already know how to code
- Understand software architecture
- Have production development experience

We skip the basics and focus on **AI-specific skills** that amplify your expertise.

### 2. Hands-On and Practical

Every lesson includes:

- Real code examples
- Interactive exercises
- Production patterns
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### 3. Continuously Updated

AI tools evolve rapidly. This course uses **versioning** to maintain historical content while adding new techniques and best practices.

### 4. Open and Free

The entire course is open-source and free. Contribute lessons, suggest improvements, or fork it for your team.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into five modules:

1. **Fundamentals** - Understanding AI coding assistants
2. **Prompting Techniques** - Effective communication with AI
3. **Tools & Workflows** - Integration into your development process
4. **Architecture & Design** - High-level system design with AI
5. **Advanced Topics** - Security, performance, and specialized use cases

## Community and Contributions

We encourage discussion and contributions:

- **GitHub Discussions** for questions and community support
- **Issues** for bug reports and suggestions
- **Pull Requests** for content improvements

## Stay Updated

We'll post regular updates here covering:

- New lessons and modules
- Case studies from real projects
- Industry trends in AI-assisted development
- Best practices and patterns

Follow along and level up your AI coding skills!
